added ubench/anagram/tests/small.x86
added ubench/dhrystone/tests/small.x86
added ubench/kepler/tests/small.x86
added ubench/parrondo/tests/small.x86

Known problems:
ubench/dhrystone:
	different gcc verison generates different results (gcc4.5 vs gcc4.1.2)
ubench/itemfile:
	not compatible with Makefile.x86. Can use g++ to hand-compile
	missing input/output files
ubench/longdiv:
	won't compile (undefined reference to `_pctype')
